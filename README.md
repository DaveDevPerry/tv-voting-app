# TerrorVision Fan Poll

<!-- A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about. -->

An app for fans to create and answer polls for anything terrorvision related.

## Game Details

Each player choses ten numbers (from available lotto numbers range). Mark off each of your numbers if the ball was drawn in the official lotto draw. The winner is the first person to match all ten numbers.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn the MERN stack so I decided to build out another Terrorvision app . Ultimately helping me closer to my goal of building out full stack applications.

## Code

I used the MERN stack for this. Although I had coded in React and Express with Mongo, I had not yet used them together for a full MERN stack app.
